# Diabetes Predicition Using Machine Learning
Diabetes Mellitus is among critical diseases and lots of people are suffering from this disease. 
Age, obesity, lack of exercise, hereditary diabetes, living style, bad diet, high blood pressure, etc. 
can cause Diabetes Mellitus. People having diabetes have high risk of diseases like heart disease, 
kidney disease, stroke, eye problem, nerve damage, etc. Current practice in hospital is to collect 
required information for diabetes diagnosis through various tests and appropriate treatment is 
provided based on diagnosis. Machine learning plays an significant role in healthcare industries. 
Healthcare industries have large volume databases. Using Machine learning algorithms one can 
study huge datasets and find hidden information, hidden patterns to discover knowledge from the 
data and predict outcomes accordingly. In existing method, the classification and prediction 
accuracy is not so high. In this paper, we have proposed a diabetes prediction model for better 
classification of diabetes which includes few external factors responsible for diabetes along with 
regular factors like Mental Health, BMI, Age, Cholesterol, etc. Classification accuracy is boosted 
with new dataset compared to existing dataset. Further with imposed a pipeline model for 
diabetes prediction intended towards improving the accuracy of classification.
